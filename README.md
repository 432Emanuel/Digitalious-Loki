# Digitalious Loki

**An AI-assisted system for digitizing and exploring local history archives**

## 🌱 Project Overview

**Digitalious Loki** is a modular digital toolset designed to support the structured digitization of analog data — particularly for local history archives such as village chronicles. Developed as a project of a data science training, the project combines automation, semantic structuring, and interactive access via an online interface.

The initial pilot project is based on the **village chronicle of Wolkramshausen** = **Wolke Cloud**, a rural community in central Germany.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Structured digitization**: Analog materials (e.g. text, photographs, hand-written notes) are scanned and processed into structured data formats (e.g. JSON) using AI assistance.
- **Chronic Kit**: A modular toolkit that provides AI-supported functionality during the digitization process — including OCR, semantic tagging, metadata extraction, and image description.
- **Interactive archive**: The digitized chronicle will be accessible through an online interface where users can browse and search events, people, and locations.
- **Live integration**: Future events (such as festivals or local incidents) can be automatically integrated into the database through simple user input (e.g. uploading a photo or filling in a short form).
- **Testbed: "Wolke Cloud"**: A playful prototype environment for testing and refining individual modules before deployment in the full system.
